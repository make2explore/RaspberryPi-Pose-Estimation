**[Project] Real Time Body Pose Estimation on Raspberry Pi using TensorFlow Lite**

This application estimates a person's pose in a scene. The deep learning model used recognizes elbows, knees, ankles, etc.  
-  <em> A fast C++ implementation of TensorFlow Lite Posenet on a bare Raspberry Pi 4 64-bit OS.</em>  

-  <em> Once overclocked to 1825 MHz, the app runs at 9.4 FPS without any hardware accelerator. </em>
